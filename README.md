# Open Table Clone

This project is a clone of [openTable](https://www.opentable.ca/) where you can look for resturants and make reservations

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
```

- Rename .env.example to .env
- Generate your database credintials (any sql db) and JWT secret and add them to the .env

3. run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
